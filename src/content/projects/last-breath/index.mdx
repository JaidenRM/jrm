This was probably my first project that I started. It was inspired from a 'Game Design' based university subject and through this project I learnt how to draw and design graphics such as UI or Sprites. It also helped expand on my C# and Unity skills.

The game's premise is around the character trying to find resources to stay alive with Minesweeper inspired gameplay. unfortunately, the source files are probably lost to the ether as I never uploaded them to an online repo :(.
