This app was inspired by my recent trip to Japan. I was excited for going overseas for the first time and thought of this as a way to use my coding skills to make something to record it. The idea is basically to mimic a photo album onto a Google Maps API. I.e. store each photo as a marker on a map with some additional information. The design is quite simple and only has core functionality (users, posts, view, storage) as this was intended to just be for me and I needed something quickly.

I may come back to this to spruce it up whether it be through additional features or 'beautifying' the display.
