This project was inspired simply by listening to music on Spotify. When I'm trying to pick a playlist to listen to, sometimes it can be quite hard to just choose one as I might feel like listening to a couple, so why not just play them all then? That's where this project came from. Spotify doesn't have an easy way to play multiple playlists at once so I went about to spin this up as a quick project so I could play multiple playlists at once.

I used my favourite frontend combo, React + TypeScript with styled-components, to create this. It also gave me good exposure to dealing with and handling RESTful APIs in React, in particular, Spotify's. The player is currently a 3rd party package that is a react/ts UI wrapper around the Spotify Web Playback SDK.
