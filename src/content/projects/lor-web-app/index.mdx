The aim of this project was to learn ReactJS as the primary goal, and secondary goals of relearning Python through a backend utilising Flask.

The idea behind this web application is to create some tools and present statistics/data on an online card game. The developers have provided an API to retrieve data from which I will use to help create this website. The basic aim at the moment is to have a deck builder, card gallery and some sort of statistics showing.
