A popular word game has taken the world by storm - Wordle! I aim to recreate this game and add some minior differences. I have created a very basic version of the game and I plan to integrate features and updates so I can closer match the actual game as well as adding improvements/features upon it.

From a technical perspective, this layered approach is to help me practice writing code that can be flexible to change, as this will be changing a lot. I'm not sure what exactly but UX update, server & client, statistics, multiple wordle versions (i.e. n letter word puzzles) are likely candidates. I look forward to chipping away at these features and seeing it drastically change and improve over time.
